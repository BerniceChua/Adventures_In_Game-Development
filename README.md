# Adventures In Game-Development
Bernice's lesson plans and tutorials for making videogames -- "traditional" videogames, virtual reality games, augmented reality games, and mixed reality games.

## Unity Tutorials

### Requirements For Unity Tutorials
Anyone is more than welcome to learn from the tutorials and take notes.  But in order to be able to follow along, please download and install the latest version of Unity on your computer.  Please do so before starting the lessons, because it is a large download (more or less 10 GB, including the Monodevelop IDE & Microsoft Visual Studio IDE) and it will take a long time.  

#### Download And Install For Windows & Mac:
