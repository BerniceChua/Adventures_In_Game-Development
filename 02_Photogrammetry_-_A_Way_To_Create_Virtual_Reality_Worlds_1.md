# Photogrammetry - A Way To Create Virtual Reality Worlds Part 1

## What is Photogrammetry?
Photogrammetry means taking tons and tons of photos of something, from various angles, then feeding all the photos into software that will stitch everything together to turn them into a computer graphics 3D model.  

## 2 Kinds Of Photogrammetry: 
1) Object Photogrammetry
2) Room-Sized (aka "Indoor") Photogrammetry

Object Photogrammetry = photogrammetry-ing something that can be moved around like a statue or a water bottle or a pillow or a living creature.
Examples:
- the people/characters in "Death Stranding".
- when people's faces are copied in the more recent "Call Of Duty" games.

Room-Sized (aka "Indoor") Photogrammetry = like the name says, it's photogrammetrying an entire area.
Examples:
- the backgrounds of "The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter"
- InternetVRArchive
- The Great Dev Bootcamp Photogrammetry Project ~ VR-Dev-Bootcamp

## Photogrammetry Software

##### Zephyr
###### Pros:
- Has a free version.
- Ideal for Object Photogrammetry
###### Cons:
- The free version has a 50-picture-per-project limit (which shouldn't be too bad for objects like coffee cups, cameras, mice, etc.)

#### RealityCapture
http://store.steampowered.com/app/489180/RealityCapture
(If you want to get this, get the Steam version to get around their DRM limitations, so the software will be tied to your account instead of tied to your hardware.)
###### Pros:
- Supposedly better for "organic" / non-geometrical shapes, supposedly better for Room-Sized (aka "Indoor") Photogrammetry.
###### Cons:
- Subscription-based, cannot "own" the software.
- Expensive, costs either $39.99/month or $109.99 for 3 months, unless Steam has a sale.
###### Since this is expensive, and Bernice is already paying for it:
- Why not join my open-source project: "The Great Dev Bootcamp Photogrammetry Project"
